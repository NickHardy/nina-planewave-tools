# PlaneWave Tools

PlaneWave Tools is a plugin for NINA that provides several instructions for controlling the EFA fans and Delta T heater controller via PlaneWave's PWI3 app.

## Requirements

* PWI3 >= 3.5.0 for fan control
* PWI3 >= 3.5.3 for fan and DeltaT control

## Sequence Instructions

* Start PWI3, Stop PWI3 - Starts and stops the PWI3.exe application
* Fan Control - Turns the OTA fans on or off
* DeltaT Control - Sets the per-heater operating modes of the Delta T heater controller

I'm open to ideas for additional controls!
